# -DropNet-Predicting-University-Dropout-Risk-in-Kenya
Predicts university dropout risk in Kenya using logistic regression based on household income, HELB support, and financial stress levels. Built with Python and Streamlit.
# üéì Kenya University Dropout Risk Predictor

A data-driven machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a university student in Kenya dropping out due to financial stress, limited HELB support, or high academic burden.

## üìå Problem Overview

Many Kenyan university students face **financial instability**, rising tuition fees, reduced government support (like HELB), and mental health struggles. These factors directly impact student retention, performance, and future opportunities.

With recent government changes in student funding, it's become crucial to understand **which students are most at risk of dropping out** ‚Äî and why.

## ‚úÖ Project Goal

To build an **interactive machine learning app** that:
- Predicts dropout risk based on a student‚Äôs background and financial data
- Highlights the impact of financial aid, scholarships, and mental health risk
- Offers policymakers and citizens a way to simulate funding outcomes

## üì• 1. Loading the Dataset & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

We began by importing a custom dataset simulating the financial and academic details of university students in Kenya.

### Why This Step Matters:
- Understanding the **structure and types of data** is critical before modeling.
- We explored key variables like `household_income`, `program_cost_per_year`, and `financial_stress_level` to identify trends, outliers, and relationships.

### Actions Taken:
- Loaded the data using Pandas
- Inspected data types, column distribution, and sample rows
- Visualized variables using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**:
  - Histograms for income & academic performance
  - Count plots for dropout risk by stress level
  - Box plots to check income vs dropout patterns

This step helped us frame the **financial vulnerability** among students and detect early signs of imbalance or skew.

## üö® 2. Handling Missing Values

Like most real-world datasets, some columns had missing values (e.g., `helb_amount`, `scholarship_amount`, and `mental_health_risk`).

### Why This Step Matters:
- Models can't learn from incomplete data
- Naively removing rows can lead to bias or data loss

### Actions Taken:
- Used **median** for numeric columns with outliers (`household_income`, `program_cost_per_year`)
- Used **0** for support-based features like `helb_amount`, `scholarship_amount`, and `other_support` ‚Äî assuming no support
- Used **mode** for categorical features like `financial_stress_level` and `mental_health_risk`

This preserved the dataset's size and kept the structure realistic without injecting false assumptions.

## üß† ML Model Use)

We trained a **Logistic Regression model** using synthetic but realistic student data to predict:
> Whether a student is likely to drop out (`1`) or not (`0`)

The model considers:
- Household income
- HELB and scholarship support
- Program cost
- Stress level and affordability basics

> The model is deployed through a fully interactive **Streamlit app** that lets users explore the dataset, visualize patterns, and make predictions based on input sliders and dropdowns.
