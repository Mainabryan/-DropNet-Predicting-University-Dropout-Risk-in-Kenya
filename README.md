# -DropNet-Predicting-University-Dropout-Risk-in-Kenya
Predicts university dropout risk in Kenya using logistic regression based on household income, HELB support, and financial stress levels. Built with Python and Streamlit.
# üéì Kenya University Dropout Risk Predictor

A data-driven machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a university student in Kenya dropping out due to financial stress, limited HELB support, or high academic burden.

---

## üìå Problem Overview

Many Kenyan university students face **financial instability**, rising tuition fees, reduced government support (like HELB), and mental health struggles. These factors directly impact student retention, performance, and future opportunities.

With recent government changes in student funding, it's become crucial to understand **which students are most at risk of dropping out** ‚Äî and why.

---

## ‚úÖ Project Goal

To build an **interactive machine learning app** that:
- Predicts dropout risk based on a student‚Äôs background and financial data
- Highlights the impact of financial aid, scholarships, and mental health risk
- Offers policymakers and citizens a way to simulate funding outcomes

---

## üß† ML Model Used

We trained a **Logistic Regression model** using synthetic but realistic student data to predict:
> Whether a student is likely to drop out (`1`) or not (`0`)

The model considers:
- Household income
- HELB and scholarship support
- Program cost
- Stress level and affordability basics

> The model is deployed through a fully interactive **Streamlit app** that lets users explore the dataset, visualize patterns, and make predictions based on input sliders and dropdowns.
